Metagenome and MAG workflow, from data QC through to MAG analysis.

Designed for Illumina sequencing, but can be used for long read by swapping QC tools and using your favourite assembler. For Nanopore, Flye in meta mode works well. Flye can be used for PacBio as well. Other PacBio options include HCAP and canu. 

This workflow uses both a local machine and HPCs, so translate as needed.
