Metagenome and MAG workflow, from data QC through to MAG analysis.

Designed for Illumina sequencing, but can be used for long read by swapping QC tools and using the appropriate assembler.
For Nanopore, Flye in meta mode works well. 
Flye can be used for PacBio as well, with HCAP and canu are other options. 

This workflow uses both a local machine and HPCs, but translate as needed.
